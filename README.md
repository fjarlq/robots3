# robots3 - fjarlq's fork of robots2

This is fjarlq's fork of [the original robots2 game][1] that was
submitted to the comp.sources.games Usenet newsgroup in July 1987
by Julian Onions.

robots2 derives from [Allan Black's original robots game][2] that
was posted to the net.sources.games Usenet group in May 1985.

fjarlq's changes include:

- Use robots-esque symbols. (`@` for player, `+` for robot, `*` for scrap)
- Use robots-esque movement rules: stepping onto robots is disallowed.
- Code cleanup.

A description of robots2 excerpted from `READ_ME.orig`:

> This version has several features over the original version but is
> still very much in the same spirit. Amongst the new features are
>
> * Fast robots, these are robots that move at twice the speed of normal robots.
> * Option settings in the style of rogue.
> * movable scrap heaps.
> * random & safe teleports with the ability to choose.
> * antimatter
>
> Bugs, comments, flames, offers of cash, aston martins to those below
> * `Julian Onions <jpo@cs.nott.ac.uk>`
> * `Graeme Lunt <gal@cs.nott.ac.uk>`
> * `Allan Black <allan@cs.strath.ac.uk>`
